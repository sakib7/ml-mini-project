# Mini Projects of Data science and Machine learning

This repo contains the reports of the mini projects of Data Science and Machine Learning courses.

## Marketing Campaign Analysis
The project aims to analyze a dataset related to direct marketing campaigns conducted by a banking institution via phone calls to clients. The primary objective is to develop predictive models using two different machine learning algorithms to forecast whether a client will respond positively or negatively to the campaign, i.e., whether they will subscribe ('yes') or not ('no') to a bank term deposit. The tasks include data preprocessing, selecting relevant features for the models, processing the data appropriately, training the models to achieve at least 80% accuracy, visualizing their performance, and comparing the results to understand any differences between the models.

## Sentiment Analysis Using Sentiment140 Dataset
The project aims to perform sentiment analysis using machine learning techniques. Sentiment analysis involves determining the sentiment expressed in a text, such as whether it is positive or negative. Our focus lies in classifying tweets whether it is positive or negative from the Sentiment140 dataset, which consists of approximately 1,60,000 annotated tweets. These tweets have been labeled with sentiment. The tasks in this project includes preparing the tweets through data preprocessing techniques to clean and transform it for the model, selecting appropriate machine learning models for sentiment analysis, and comparing their effectiveness. Data preprocessing involves steps such as removing unnecessary characters, tokenizing, padding and embedding. Model selection involves exploring various algorithms, from traditional methods like Logistic Regression to advanced deep learning architectures like CNNs and RNNs. Finally, performance visualization entails calculating metrics such as accuracy and employing visualizations like confusion matrices to compare the models' performance.

## Human Activity Clustering Based on Sensor Data
This project aims to apply K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms to a given dataset. The tasks include determining the optimal number of clusters, finding optimal parameters, and understanding the impact of dimensionality reduction on clustering. I will have to compare the outcome of these models before and after dimensionality reduction was performed. Finally I will have to visualize the clusters. The dataset used in this project comprises sensor data collected from 30 volunteers, aged between 19 to 48 years, who wore a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on their waist while performing various activities. There are in total 361 columns in the dataset. Here is the google colab link:

## Data science project 1
In this project, I was engaged in a series of interconnected tasks that combined collecting flight data by scraping, cleaning the scraped data, performing exploratory data analysis on it, and finally let the end-user filter and sort the dataset. My overarching objective is to leverage web scraping techniques to acquire flight data, process and clean this data to ensure accuracy and consistency, perform exploratory data analysis to extract meaningful insights, and ultimately deliver a solution that offers travelers the cheapest and fastest flight options based on their unique requirements. I have scrapped the flights based on a chosen date and city. 

## Data science project 2
The aim of the project is to utilize two different supervised learning methods to make predictions about the final grades of students in an online course. Dataset was gathered from a fully online, nine-week machine learning course delivered through the Moodle online learning management system. The dataset comprised anonymized data pertaining to 107 enrolled students. This data included students' scores from 3 mini projects, 3 quizzes, 3 peer reviews, and their final overall grade, as well as their activity logs within the course.

## Data science project 3
This project did an extensive network analysis of a Facebook-like Social Network, encompassing 1,899 users and 59,835 messages exchanged. The main goals were to identify active users, top message recipients, influential users, calculate node distances for recommendations, and detect communities. These analyses are pivotal for gaining insights into user engagement, understanding influence dynamics, and uncovering intricate network structures in diverse social and online communities.
